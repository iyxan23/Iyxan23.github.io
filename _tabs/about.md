Hi all! I'm Nur Ihsan Al Ghifari, people IRL call me Ihsan but I'm more commonly known throughout the internet
(and communities) as iyxan23!

I'm a super passionate and very curious coder ever since I touched my first ever piece of technology, it was
when I was about in my 3rd year of my elementary school (which is about 2017).

My journey started when I discovered an app named "Sketchware". It blew my mind! I was able to create working,
living, and installable android apps in my android phone!

I made several programs, even made an app for my teacher, which made them quite impressed. My class started
calling me the crazy coding kid, because I really love to show my passion for programming to them! Haha, I
think I was a bit too much! (full life story [here](/posts/Life-Story))

Years of elementary school was a bit boring for little iyxan, since he didn't get much time and resources
developing his skills. Until the next big thing happened. The mighty pandemic.

Coronavirus spread across the world, forcing people to stay within the boundaries of their home. I was in
that lockdown, at my house, having nothing to do, and bored. So I decided to join online communities,
which surprisingly, boosted my english abilities by almost 1000%! I made a lot of friends online, and made
a lot of cool stuff with them as well.

The times during the pandemic were a bit rough, but I had entered my own world, with my own friends, and
developed my programming skills even further by the help of my newfound english.

Akh, I can't believe the amount of projects I made! It was like a disease. I was once developing a single
project, had some fun with it, then came in another project idea. Trashed the previous project, work on
another one. And the cycle goes on and on. It never stopped.

It was fun and all, until I realised the big pile of abandoned projects that I made. Uhh, noone's going to
mess with those... Though, in the bright side, I learned a lot of cool technologies from many different fields!
Like Android, Fullstack webdev, Linuxy stuff (I daily drove arch at that time), low-level programming and
so many cool things. (check out my [github](https://github.com/iyxan23))

It was a really fun experience when I was at my middle school days (in my home).

Until everything changed as I enter The Vocational High School of IDN Boarding School. It changed my entire
view about life. It made me connect with a lot of really awesome people, went overseas for the first time
(to malaysia), and probably is the peak of my programming life as a teen. (new articles incoming)

Thanks for reading!
